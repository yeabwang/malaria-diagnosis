# Malaria Diagnosis V 1.1

## About the Model
This binary classification model aims to diagnose malaria by classifying infected cells. The model is trained on the [malaria dataset](https://lhncbc.nlm.nih.gov/LHC-downloads/downloads.html#malaria-datasets), which contains 27,558 cell images from blood smears. I split the dataset into three sets for training, validation, and testing, with a ratio of 0.8/0.1/0.1, respectively. The images are augmented using custom and Keras layer augmentations, including resizing, rescaling, random horizontal and vertical flips, random rotations, zooming, adding noise, and varying brightness to enhance the model's versatility.

The model consists of three convolutional layers for feature extraction, each followed by max pooling. It also includes three dense layers, each with a dropout layer (rate = 0.5). ReLU is used in the hidden layers, and sigmoid is used in the output layer.

- Optimizer: Adam with a learning rate of 0.001
- Loss function: Binary Cross-Entropy
- Trained for 10 epochs, with 689 batches of images per epoch.

### Accuracy and Loss Graph
The model achieves an accuracy of 95.61% and a loss of 0.17.

# About the Disease

## Definition and Cause
Malaria is a life-threatening disease transmitted to humans primarily through the bites of infected female *Anopheles* mosquitoes. It is caused by a parasitic infection, specifically by five *Plasmodium* species. Malaria is most prevalent in tropical regions and is both preventable and curable. The disease does not spread directly from person to person but can also be transmitted through blood transfusions and contaminated needles.

The initial symptoms of malaria are often mild and nonspecific, making it challenging to diagnose early. If left untreated, particularly in cases caused by *Plasmodium falciparum*, malaria can rapidly progress to severe illness and death within 24 hours.

## Malaria Parasite Species
There are five species of *Plasmodium* that cause malaria in humans:

- **P. falciparum**: The deadliest and most common species in Africa.
- **P. vivax**: Dominant outside of sub-Saharan Africa.
- **P. malariae**, **P. ovale**, and **P. knowlesi**: Less common, but still capable of infecting humans.

## Global Malaria Statistics (2023)
According to the *World Malaria Report*:

- **Cases**: 263 million cases in 2023, compared to 252 million in 2022.
- **Deaths**: 597,000 deaths in 2023, with a mortality rate of 13.7 per 100,000 people.
- **Geographical Distribution**: 
  - **Africa**: The WHO African Region carries 94% of global malaria cases and 95% of deaths.
  - **Other Regions**: The WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region has seen a 57% increase in incidence since 2021.

## High-Burden Countries
The top five countries with the highest malaria burden in 2023 were:

- **Nigeria** (26%)
- **Democratic Republic of the Congo** (13%)
- **Uganda** (5%)
- **Ethiopia** (4%)
- **Mozambique** (4%)

## Challenges to Malaria Control
- **Anopheles stephensi**: This mosquito species, native to South Asia and the Arabian Peninsula, has spread into Africa, complicating malaria control efforts. It thrives in urban environments, resists common insecticides, and tolerates high temperatures.
- **Pregnancy and Malaria**: In 2023, 12.4 million pregnancies in the WHO African Region were affected by malaria, with an estimated 551,000 cases of low birthweight averted through intervention.

# Diagnosis of Malaria

## Blood Smears: The Gold Standard
Blood smears remain the gold standard for malaria diagnosis. The process involves blood collection, preparation of thick and thin blood smears, staining, and microscopic examination. This method is effective but requires skilled personnel and adequate resources.

### Steps to Perform a Blood Smear for Malaria Diagnosis

#### 1. Blood Collection
- **Venous or Capillary Blood**: Blood can be obtained from a vein (venipuncture) or a fingertip (capillary blood), with capillary blood being more common in resource-limited settings.
- **Quantity**: A small amount (2-3 drops) is sufficient for multiple smears.

#### 2. Preparing the Smear
- **Thick Blood Smear**: Concentrates blood cells to detect parasites at low levels.
  - Place a drop of blood at the center of a slide and spread it in a circular motion using another slide edge. Let it dry.
- **Thin Blood Smear**: Used for species identification and assessing the stage of infection.
  - Place a drop of blood near the slide’s edge and spread it evenly. Let it dry.

#### 3. Staining the Smears
- **Giemsa Stain**: Dipped in Giemsa solution for 10-15 minutes, then rinsed and air-dried.
- **Leishman Stain**: A similar alternative to Giemsa.

#### 4. Microscopic Examination
- **Thick Smear**: Examine under low magnification (100x or 400x) for parasite presence and estimate density (parasites per 100 or 500 red blood cells).
- **Thin Smear**: Examine under high magnification (1000x with oil immersion) for species identification, focusing on trophozoites, schizonts, and gametocytes.

### Key Identification Features:
- **P. falciparum**: Small rings, rare schizonts, crescent-shaped gametocytes.
- **P. vivax**: Larger rings, 12-24 merozoites in schizonts, Schuffner’s dots.
- **P. malariae**: Small, compact rings, 6-12 merozoites, Ziemann’s dots.
- **P. ovale**: Oval-shaped red blood cells, 8-12 merozoites in schizonts.

#### 5. Interpretation of Results
- **Positive Results**: Identify the parasite species and estimate parasite density. High parasite density indicates severe malaria.
- **Negative Results**: If no parasites are detected, the test is negative. However, if malaria is suspected, repeat testing or alternative diagnostic methods (e.g., Rapid Diagnostic Tests (RDTs) or PCR) may be needed.

## Advantages and Limitations of Blood Smears

### Advantages:
- Accurate species identification.
- Estimation of parasite density.
- Ability to assess various parasite stages.

### Limitations:
- Skill-dependent; requires experienced microscopists.
- Time-consuming and labor-intensive.
- Low sensitivity in cases with low parasitemia or early stages of infection.

### Erythrocytic Phase of Malaria

- **Invasion**: Merozoites released from the liver enter red blood cells (erythrocytes).
- **Development**: Inside red blood cells, the parasite transforms into trophozoites, which mature into schizonts.
- **Reproduction**: Schizonts undergo division to produce new merozoites.
- **Release**: Merozoites are released when red blood cells rupture, causing symptoms like fever, chills, and sweating.
- **Cycle Continuation**: New merozoites invade additional red blood cells, perpetuating the cycle and exacerbating the disease.
